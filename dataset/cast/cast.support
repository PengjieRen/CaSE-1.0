In the 1960s, however, applied linguistics was expanded to include language assessment, language policy, and second language acquisition. As early as the 1970s, applied linguistics became a problem-driven field rather than theoretical linguistics, including the solution of language-related problems in the real world.	By the 1990s, applied linguistics had broadened including critical studies and multilingualism. Research in applied linguistics was shifted to "the theoretical and empirical investigation of real world problems in which language is a central issue."

Cissbury was one of several important mining industries in the UK during the Neolithic and is thought to have been used into the Bronze age, and later the Iron Age though flint mining probably stopped during the late neolithic, but there is some evidence of re-use of flint for tools during later times. Axes and Blades (struck from cores) account for most of the tools produced at Cissbury and examples of Cissbury flint can be found as far as Italy.

Sir William Jones proposed that Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, Gothic, and Celtic languages all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique gnrale created the development of descriptive linguistics.

Fries, who established the English Language Institute (ELI) at the University of Michigan in 1941. In 1948, the Research Club at Michigan established Language Learning: A Journal of Applied Linguistics, the first journal to bear the term applied linguistics. In the late 1960s, applied linguistics began to establish its own identity as an interdisciplinary field of linguistics concerned with real-world language issues. The new identity was solidified by the creation of the American Association for Applied Linguistics in 1977.			
	18_1	CAR_575f4373eae1b8459c13bd13368441dffaaeaa4e	Uranus was discovered by amateur astronomer William Herschel on 13 March 1781. Uranus exhibits the ideals of the 18th century, where people such as Benjamin Franklin endeavoured to use their inventive mind to move man into a more enlightened era.  It has an orbit of 84 years, staying in each sign of the zodiac for approximately 7 years.  Uranus is considered to be a higher octave of Mercury, which means that as people develop within their selves, their character and means of communication will exhibit more influences of the sign and house of Uranus.  In essence, Uranus can be seen as a person's higher self.  Because it takes Uranus 84 years to travel through the zodiac, transiting Uranus just might conjoin the natal Uranus within a person's lifetime.
