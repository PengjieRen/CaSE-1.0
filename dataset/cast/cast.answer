2_1	2_2	MARCO_2533087	Dutch Farmers took the Boer goat to South Africa for meat production because it is docile, fertile, grows fast, and adaptable. It has white fur with a red head.
	25_1	MARCO_3900842	I would describe Orca whales as Killer Whale or less commonly known as Black-fish. It is the largest species of the dolphin family, though they are commonly mistaken as a species of whale. They are called killer whales because they sometimes hunt whales for food.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5	17_6	MARCO_5309528	Sound is matter vibrating, and vibrations are a type of mechanical energy which requires an object with which it can move through such as water or air.
2_1	2_2	MARCO_3449246	Boer goats are the breed of goats that were developed in  South Africa in the early 1900s for meat production. In Afrikaans, or Dutch, 'boer' means farmer. Boer goats are a popular breed for meat and their breeding season starts in August and runs through December.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5	17_6	MARCO_2630282	I think that sound is mechanical energy, and anything that exhibits movement can make sound, but something must move to supply that mechanical energy that will create a sound.
25_1	25_2	MARCO_2357958	In actuality, orcas are in the dolphin family.
2_1	2_2	CAR_0bca2331b28d15a7827f553a0b89ac7144a50e20	As far as I know, Boer goat was probably bred from the indigenous goats and they originated from South Africa. Also, they were selected for meat rather than milk production; due to selective breeding and improvement, the Boer goat has a fast growth rate and excellent carcass qualities, making it one of the most popular breeds of meat goat in the world. They have high resistance to disease and adapt well to hot, dry semi deserts.
25_1	25_2	MARCO_5655009	No, they are not. They are members of the Delphinidae (dolphin) family.
2_1	2_2	CAR_f2362758b6027d9b31c103ad0b2866238f635dc0	According to my knowledge, Boer goats commonly have white bodies and distinctive brown heads. They are noted for being docile, fast-growing, and having high fertility rates.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5	17_6	MARCO_5309532	Sound energy is involves the movement of atoms, thus it is mechanical.
2_1	2_2	MARCO_3907237	They are from South Africa and are used only for meat production.
25_1	25_2	MARCO_5417927	No, they aren't whales. They are actually a type of dolphin.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5	17_6	MARCO_2246061	Sound is mechanical energy because it is caused by movement.
25_1	25_2	MARCO_4332164	I don't think so. Killer whales are not really a whale at all but are members of the dolphin family.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5	17_6	MARCO_5309529	I think a sound is a form of mechanical energy because it is associated with the vibration or disturbance of matter. Sound is a mechanical wave and as such consists physically in oscillatory elastic compression and the oscillatory displacement of a fluid.
2_1	2_2	MARCO_8128366	I know that the Boer goat was developed in South Africa as a breed meant solely for meat production. The term 'Boer' refers to the descendants of the Dutch immigrants, or Boers, most of them farmers, so 'Boer' goat simply means 'farmer's' goat.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5	17_6	MARCO_1340134	A sound wave is a mechanical wave because mechanical waves can't go through a vacuum, and sound waves can't.
2_1	2_2	MARCO_3307030	Boer goats commonly have white bodies and distinctive brown heads, some Boer goats can be completely brown or white or have large spots of a different color is on their bodies. They possess long, pendulous ears, and are noted for being docile, fast-growing, and having high fertility rates.
25_1	25_2	MARCO_9380	I am sure that killer whales are not whales at all and they are, in fact, dolphins.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6	17_7	MARCO_381801	From what I know, mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy present in the components of a mechanical system.
2_1	2_2	MARCO_3449244	From what I can tell, Boer goat is a breed of goat that was developed in South Africa in the early 1900s for meat production. Their name is derived from the Afrikaans or Dutch word boer, meaning farmer. Their breeding season starts in August and runs through December.
25_1	25_2	MARCO_9375	Actually, killer whales are dolphins, not whales. They got that name because they attack real whales.

25_1	25_2	MARCO_2241808	As per my knowledge, Orca whales are not whales but are members of the dolphin family. They are the largest, fastest and most powerful members of the dolphin family and are called killer whales because of their great hunting skills.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6	17_7	MARCO_381800	Mechanical energy is both the kinetic energy which is motion, and the potential energy which is the position and these atee the energy that is stored in the different parts of mechanical parts.
25_1	25_2	MARCO_2975352	No, they are not, hey are actually members of the Delphinidae family.
2_1	2_2	MARCO_8358396	I feel that to cope up with increasing demand for goat meat around the world, Boer goat is a popular choice among producers. It was developed in South Africa in the early 1900s.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6	17_7	MARCO_5360939	Sound is different from potential energy because it is caused by motion. Potential energy is energy that is stored.
25_1;25_2	25_3	MARCO_5417920	Orcas are very large, and very strong and hunt in packs as a result they hunt creatures larger than themselves.
25_1;25_2	25_3	MARCO_4401073	Orcas hunt in large groups -- pods of up to 40 individuals.  They have large teeth (up to 4 inches long), and can swim up to a seal on the ice and grab it.
2_1	2_2	MARCO_3307027	Boer goats are originally from South Africa, they usually have a reddish-brown head and a white body; they are typically around 200-400 pounds the males (called bucks) and 150-300 pounds the females (called does).
2_1	2_2	MARCO_2533084	I can tell you that Boer goat is a highly meat productive goat breed which originated from South Africa. They are of very big sized goat among the other popular meat goat breeds. They also produce large quantities of milk. They are generally white with red or brown heads.
25_1;25_2;25_3	25_4	MARCO_2993437	They eat large animals such as fish and marine mammals like seals or even whales.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6	17_7	MARCO_3183277	I can say that the mechanical energy of an object can be the result of its motion, that is, kinetic energy. So,  the total amount of mechanical energy is merely the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy.
2_1;2_2	2_3	MARCO_1188047	Fainting goats can be used for meat; they can weigh up to 170 pounds.
25_1;25_2;25_3	25_4	MARCO_3396248	Killer whales eat anything in the water that isn't poisonous, or human, and in Alaska they have even been seen eating deer trying to cross the straits.
2_1;2_2	2_3	MARCO_1632359	The races that are good for meat are Spanish goats, Surplus or cull Angora and cashmere goats.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6	17_7	MARCO_3183278	Potential energy is a type of mechanical energy as is kinetic energy.
25_1;25_2;25_3	25_4	MARCO_6142843	Orcas eat meat and fish.  The exact variety depends on where they live.  In the Antarctic, orca diet is about 67% fish, 27% marine mammals, and 6% squid. Occasionally, orcas also eat other orcas.
2_1;2_2	2_3	MARCO_2782471	For meat, there are good breeds like Dadiangas Goat. This breed is cross between the native goat and other breeds like Nubian and Jumnapari. Other good milkes include Saanen, Alpine, La Mancha, and Toggenburg. A new, widely adapted meat breed is the Boer Goat from South Africa.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6	17_7	MARCO_8733578	The potential energy of mechanical energy is that which is stored, rather than that which is actively being used.
25_1;25_2;25_3	25_4	MARCO_9378	Killer whales eat anything that they come across in the water that they live in such as fish, squid, penguins, seals, sea lions, even other whales.
2_1;2_2	2_3	MARCO_1827207	There is a breed of goat called Janunapari, Jamnapari, and Ram Sagol.  They produce meat.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6	17_7	MARCO_3183276	I think both are different because Mechanical energy is the sum of energy in a mechanical system, or any group of objects that interact based on basic mechanical principles whereas Potential energy (PE) is a product of the object's height above the ground (h), its mass (m), and the Earth's gravitational acceleration (g, which is 9.8 m/s 2).
25_1;25_2;25_3	25_4	MARCO_4401073	Orcas eat sea lions, seals, whales, fish, squid, and even sea birds.
2_1;2_2	2_3	MARCO_1188043	Well, I call tell you that Fainting goats don't have a good trait for true meat goat but yet they are classified as meat goat.
2_1;2_2	2_3	CAR_af6275112653b4dc65c42b8e29712b27429f52c5	I think the fainting goat is classified as a meat goat and it can be raised for chevon, that is goat meat. It is specialised for smaller production operations as they are unable to challenge fences as other goat breeds.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6;17_7	17_8	MARCO_618063	Basically, kinetic energy is energy being created by motion while potential is energy that could happen with movement. You can think of the difference as being present vs. potential future.
25_1;25_2;25_3	25_4	MARCO_2975349	Orcas eat a variety of meat and seafood -- whatever they can catch.  This includes fish, turtles, birds, seals, sharks and even other whales.

17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6;17_7	17_8	MARCO_4365799	No, they are not the same. The two main types of energy are potential energy, and kinetic energy.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6;17_7	17_8	MARCO_3814687	No, potential energy is energy stored, while kinetic energy is due to movement.
2_1;2_2;2_3	2_4	MARCO_1632359	I don't think so because a good fiber-producing goat is generally a poor meat goat and vice versa. But surplus or cull Angora and cashmere goats are also used for meat.
25_1;25_2;25_3	25_4	MARCO_7074031	I found it very interesting to tell because toothed whales are predators and they hunt for their food. Toothed whales might eat seals, fish or sea lions.
25_1;25_2;25_3;25_4	25_5	MARCO_9380	As far as I know, their scientific name is Orcinus orca, which is the source of their other common name, orca. Their other name is killer whale but it causes many misconceptions about this noble beast as these are not whales at all.
2_1;2_2;2_3	2_4	MARCO_1586170	Mostly meat goats are Boer goats, and and angora goats are primarily used for their wool.
25_1;25_2;25_3;25_4	25_5	MARCO_5417920	You should know that the scientific name of the killer whale is Orcinus orca and so they are also called as Orca. Also, killer whales are not whales but they are dolphins. They have been observed hunting whales and so they are called killed whales.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6;17_7	17_8	MARCO_8140872	Potential and kinetic energies are different in function, though potential energy can turn into kotential energy.
25_1;25_2;25_3;25_4	25_5	MARCO_5417927	The Greeks and Romans named them orcas, and Spanish Sailors called them killer whales.
2_1;2_2;2_3	2_4	MARCO_1632360	Not really, pal, their meat and milk production is not profitable enough like other goat breeds.
17_1;17_2;17_3;17_4;17_5;17_6;17_7	17_8	MARCO_1487829	No, they are not the same. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. A swinging pendulum has kinetic energy. Potential energy is the energy due to an object's position. For example, a ball sitting on a table has potential energy with respect to the floor because gravity acts upon it.

	18_1	MARCO_2333827	I can tell you that Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third largest of the nine planets in size.
2_1;2_2;2_3;2_4;2_5;2_6	2_7	MARCO_1009387	I have read that the fine fiber comes from the Angora goat which is native to Angora region in Turkey. It grows beautiful long curly locks of fiber.
	18_1	MARCO_3005104	Uranus is the tilted planet. The axis through its North and South Poles is tilted by 98, which means Uranus is lying on its side! That's not all-the magnetic field of Uranus is tilted, too. Uranus has a strange magnetic field.
2_1;2_2;2_3;2_4;2_5;2_6	2_7	MARCO_2954402	I found goats to be very versatile since they can be used for fiber as well as milk and meat. Angora, Pygora and Cashmere goats are best for fiber production. Angora and Pygora goats yield mohair, while Cashmere goats produce cashmere.
	18_1	MARCO_5795652	I know that Uranus Is the coldest planet in the Solar System. It needs 84 Earth years to orbit the Sun. It is 63 times bigger and 15 times heavier than Earth.

18_1	18_2	MARCO_2218290	Uranus is huge; much bigger than Earth. Its atmosphere is mainly helium. It is extremely cold, with a strangely cool core. Weirdest of all, Uranus rotates at an angle of 99 degrees.
	4_1	MARCO_813729	The Neolithic Revolution, which begun 11,000 years ago, was when people chose to favor settle and grow crops instead of constant hunting and gathering.
18_1	18_2	CAR_aa7c44870db3591e2a7cbe5bc7c492d4c52499e8	I feel that Uranus is unusual because its axis tilted at about 90 degrees, meaning that its axis is roughly parallel to the plane of the ecliptic. Due to this unusual orientation of its axis, Uranus is exposed to many years of either continuous sunlight or darkness.

This means that one pole is pointing away from the sun (light) and the other pole is pointing toward the sun (dark). One year on Uranus is 84 years so the polar regions are dark or light for long periods of time.
	4_1	MARCO_2253186	The Neolithic Revolution, as I know it, was the time when many people all over the world changed from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering, to one of farming and settlements.
	27_1	MARCO_608144	From my knowledge, a balanced died should contain  the right combination of proteins, carbohydrates, dairy products, fruits and vegetables -- and yes, even some healthy fats. Whole grains are an important part of a balanced diet because they supply complex carbohydrates.
18_1	18_2	MARCO_5776963	As far as I know, Uranus is unusual because of the following reasons. Its diameter is almost 4 times that of earth's diameter. It is 15 times heavier than the earth. It spins at around 98 degrees axis which makes it lie almost on its sides.
	27_1	MARCO_1024865	Your balanced diet should include a good combination of proteins, carbohydrates, dairy products, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats.
	4_1	MARCO_5949879	The Neolithic Revolution was when humans stopped making tools from stones and bones and started cultivating crops and domesticating animals.
18_1	18_2	MARCO_6731604	Uranus is unusual because of its spin axis that is 98 degrees to the perpendicular and makes the planet lie almost on its sides. Nobody knows the reason behind it.
	27_1	MARCO_5613590	To eat a balanced diet, you will need carbohydrates, proteins (15% of our calories), fats (30-35%), vitamins and minerals.
	4_1	MARCO_2253183	It was when humanity changed from hunting and gathering food to settle to do agriculture.
	27_1	MARCO_1024867	I think that whole grains are an important part of a balanced diet as they supply complex carbohydrates, which burn off slowly throughout the day.
	4_1	MARCO_4741771	The Neolithic revolution was a major restructuring of human affairs that mainly took place in the Near and Middle East.
	27_1	MARCO_1024870	The USDA food pyramid contains several groups of foods.  A balanced diet should include some foods from each group.
18_1	18_2	MARCO_6021268	Uranus has high southern latitude rotation which is unusual and may be because of the interior of the planet being unusual.
	4_1	MARCO_813730	It was the time in history when humans learned how to farm and domesticate animals.
	27_1	MARCO_2454395	I can tell you that a balanced diet means that you do not eat too much of just one thing.  For instance, if you eat nothing but rice, pasta, potatoes, bread, and corn, then that is NOT a balanced diet because it has too many starches and not enough protein, fiber, or fat.
18_1	18_2	MARCO_4115261	The strange thing is its poles point towards the Sun so it gets 42 years of sun, then 42 years of darkness.
	4_1	CAR_59ab9577e1b3ffad26c9ffdda6dda91205698eaa	The Neolithic revolution was the rise of governing, urbanization and states.
	4_1	MARCO_2253180	From what I can tell, the Neolithic Revolution is important for developments in social organisation and technology. It led to living in permanent or semi-permanent settlements and resulted in fewer people living a nomadic lifestyle.
	27_1	MARCO_1861783	The basis for alanced diet are foods that are high in vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients and low in unnecessary fats and sugars.
18_1	18_2	CAR_afb8a4e43a3532f4fa3d1d3421631c88c1c75c7a	Ok.. assuming you know what obliquity means, Uranus is unusual in that obliquity of its ecliptic is 82. Ecliptic is the angle between the orbital and rotational poles.
	27_1	MARCO_1024869	To have a balanced diet you have to eat foods from all food groups in the right proportions.
18_1	18_2	MARCO_8535347	I can tell you that Uranus is distinguished by the fact that it is tipped on its side. Its unusual position is thought to be the result of a collision with a planet-sized body early in the solar system's history.
	27_1	MARCO_4660088	A balanced diet comprises foods from all the main food groups in the correct proportions to provide the body with optimum nutrition, with the correct number of calories to maintain a healthy weight, and be low in processed foods.  It also needs to provide a source of calcium as well as vitamin D.
	4_1	MARCO_6773716	The Neolithic Revolution was when agriculture grew so that people could grow more food for larger populations.
18_1	18_2	CAR_dd9ab0d6af12817d7dff16d23d0db83689757085	Uranus has a retrograde rotation, and its axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the Solar System. This might be due to a historic crash with a protoplanet.

27_1	27_2	MARCO_1181833	As far as I know, a balanced diet is the same for men as well as women because a balanced diet involves eating a variety of foods that give you the most nutrients for the calories they contain. The World Health Organization notes that the vitamins and minerals found in a balanced diet may boost your immune function and prevent illness.
	4_1	MARCO_2090794	Hi. The Neolithic Revolution, also known as Neolithic Demographic Transition, or Agricultural Revolution meant that lots of people were changing from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement, making possible an increasingly larger population.
27_1	27_2	MARCO_608144	The right combination of food types is key to an individual's nutritional needs.
18_1;18_2	18_3	MARCO_6254135	Uranus is very far away from the sun son it takes 84.3 Earth years for Uranus to complete its orbit
	4_1	MARCO_813732	It was a big change in history, it began agriculture, or crop growing and stopped nomadic movement since people could grow food, they didn't need to hunt every day.
27_1	27_2	MARCO_1024870	The USDA believes both men and women should eat a balanced diet that includes food from each of the groups contained in their food pyramid.
18_1;18_2	18_3	MARCO_2865656	Uranus takes 84 years to orbit the Sun. It orbits on its side, causing its hemispheres to have 42 years of daytime and nighttime.
	4_1	CAR_c978883d2c3b09a3d66f15747122f0713ef76889	It was a wide-scale demographic transition, many human cultures changed from hunter-gatherers to agriculture and settlement that supported an increase in population. Various forms of plants and animal domestication evolved in separate locations worldwide
27_1	27_2	MARCO_1024865	From what I know, a nutritious diet has the right combination of proteins, carbohydrates, dairy products, fruits, vegetables and even some healthy fats. Whole grains are an important part of a balanced diet because they supply complex carbohydrates.
4_1	4_2	MARCO_5949879	The Neolithic Revolution had its beginnings around 10,000 BCE, when crops were first cultivated and animals domesticated.
27_1	27_2	MARCO_1861783	Everyone should try to obtain the majority of their daily calories from fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in order to have a balanced diet. These provide the most nutrients.
18_1;18_2	18_3	MARCO_6253308	I believe that the orbit of Uranus is at a distance of 2.8 billion kilometers (1.7 billion miles) from the sun and it completes one orbit every 84 years.
4_1	4_2	MARCO_42746	The Neolithic Revolution began in the 7th millennium BC and ended by the end of the 28th century BC.

4_1	4_2	CAR_59ab9577e1b3ffad26c9ffdda6dda91205698eaa	I only know when it began, and it was in Mesopotamia, from around 10,000 BCE, with civilizations developing from 6,500 years ago.
27_1	27_2	MARCO_608153	I can only say that everyone's bodies are different and often individuals require a different amount and type of nutrients.
18_1;18_2	18_3	MARCO_8535347	Uranus is 1.7 billion miles from the Sun and that distance means its orbit takes a long time, it takes Uranus 84 years to orbit the Sun.
4_1	4_2	MARCO_813729	I'm not sure of the end of the Neolithic Revolution, but it began 11,000 years ago when people begin using agricultural methods and created societies.
27_1	27_2	MARCO_6032953	I sincerely believe that a well-balanced diet means eating the appropriate amount of foods that provide adequate vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients to keep the organs, tissues and body cells functioning properly. So, it should be same for men as well as women.

18_1;18_2;18_3	18_4	CAR_aa7c44870db3591e2a7cbe5bc7c492d4c52499e8	I think that Uranus is extremely tilted off its axis is the result of a collision between the accumulating planet Uranus with another planet-sized body early in the history of the Solar System.
27_1	27_2	MARCO_608147	A balanced diet is one that includes items from each of the USDA's food groups. Their recommendations are based on all adults, not just men and women.
4_1;4_2	4_3	MARCO_813726	The Neolithic Revolution began when people started farming because they realized planting the seeds from food they gathered grew more food.
27_1	27_2	MARCO_2454395	Well, in general, for everyone, a balanced diet refers to a diet that does not have too much of just one thing.
18_1;18_2;18_3	18_4	MARCO_8169207	No one knows how Uranus got tipped, but one theory is that an encounter with another large planet twisted its spin billions of years ago.
27_1	27_2	MARCO_1024871	It is true for all the people that a balanced diet means eating and drinking the right types and amounts of food, so that you get the nutrition and energy drinks that your cells, tissues, and organs need. You also need it for your normal growth and development.
4_1;4_2	4_3	CAR_c978883d2c3b09a3d66f15747122f0713ef76889	The Neolithic Revolution was an Agricultural Revolution where people stopped hunting and gathering food and started domesticating animals and planting food.
18_1;18_2;18_3	18_4	CAR_dd9ab0d6af12817d7dff16d23d0db83689757085	It isn't known why Uranus has such an unusual tilt, but it is assumed that when the solar system was being created a protoplanet that was as big as Earth hit it and knocked it askew.
27_1;27_2	27_3	MARCO_6726106	I can tell you that pregnant women should have a diet that consists of a variety foods including proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and fats.
4_1;4_2	4_3	MARCO_2253183	As per my understanding, the Neolithic revolution was the first agricultural revolution and it was a gradual change from nomadic hunting to agriculture and settlement. It started because it changed the way of life of communities which made this change.
18_1;18_2;18_3;18_4	18_5	MARCO_6731605	Uranus has a retrograde rotation, unlike all planets but Venus, and its axial tilt causes it to rotate nearly in its orbital plane.
27_1;27_2	27_3	MARCO_608147	The USDA believes all adults should eat from the food groups in their food pyramid. This is essential for a healthy lifestyle.
4_1;4_2	4_3	MARCO_813729	Food was able to be obtained reliably with planting food seeds and animal domestication.
27_1;27_2	27_3	MARCO_1024870	Well the diet of an adult that eats about 2000 calories in a day would involve eating from each of the food groups on the food pyramid.
4_1;4_2	4_3	MARCO_2253181	As far as I know Neolithic revolution started because of following three reasons. 1 Domestication for religious reasons. 2 Domestication because of crowding and stress. 3 Domestication from the food-gatherers.
27_1;27_2	27_3	MARCO_1790241	Women need different vitamins than men and eating a balanced diet is the easiest way to obtain them.
27_1;27_2;27_3	27_4	MARCO_5223609	Dairy products are not necessary for good health. They might even contribute to cancers.
4_1;4_2	4_3	MARCO_5949881	Humans began to cultivate crops anf domesticate animals and needed new tools to go along with this way of living, so they made metal tools and plows.
27_1;27_2;27_3	27_4	MARCO_4237965	I actually think lactose intolerance is a common problem since people don't have lactase enzyme to digest the natural sugar found in dairy. This cause a buildup of gas and within a couple of hours they start to get stomach cramps and diarrhea.

27_1;27_2;27_3	27_4	MARCO_2227560	I sincerely believe that dairy products are necessary for good health but we should consider good and bad dairy products for diabetics. Good dairy products for diabetics include yogurt without added sugar, skimmed milk, low-fat yogurt, etc. Bad choices of dairy products for diabetics: Whole milk, regular yogurt with sugar, ice cream, cheese, etc.
4_1;4_2;4_3	4_4	CAR_412cbeb4db735fc8d0ecad48fb24ee3aa723422e	The first stage was agriculture, the second stage was machine tools as well as the steam engine, and the third stage was computers, robotics and automatic production.
27_1;27_2;27_3	27_4	MARCO_41261	I think that because dairy products are a major source of calcium,  avoiding them could increase risk for osteoporosis.
18_1;18_2;18_3;18_4;18_5	18_6	MARCO_7663786	Uranus has four seasons, but it takes 84 years to orbit the Sun, so each season is 21 years long.
18_1;18_2;18_3;18_4;18_5	18_6	MARCO_2865662	As I know, each season on Uranus lasts 21 Earth years. Its seasons are different from that of Earth because the tilts of our planets are different. It would be shining on Uranus' poles, making it summer on half the planet, and winter on the other half.
27_1;27_2;27_3	27_4	MARCO_1782131	As far as I can say, you don't really need milk and dairy products are in your diet, and, in fact, they can be harmful to your health.
4_1;4_2;4_3	4_4	MARCO_6604891	As far as I know, pottery was invented during the Neolithic Stone Age but some people also believe that the art of writing began in the Neolithic Stone Age.
18_1;18_2;18_3;18_4;18_5	18_6	MARCO_5876145	As per my knowledge, the length of Uranus seasons are different from ours because it takes Earth 365 days to orbit around the sun, but it takes Uranus 84 Earth-years, more or less. So Uranus year is 84 Earth-years long and each season on Uranus lasts about 21 earthly years.
